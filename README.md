## Implementation Details

In our implementation, we employed `qcustomplot` for data visualization needs. We also integrated the observer design pattern to maintain a modular and flexible codebase.

## Organization of the Submission

Our submission is organized as follows:
deliverables folder:
- `Comp 3004 Use Cases.pdf`: A document detailing all the use cases identified during the project's planning phase.
- `ConnectionLostSequence.png`: Sequence diagram illustrating the system's behavior when a connection is lost.
- `HistoryViewingSequence.png`: Sequence diagram showing the process of viewing historical data within the system.
- `MainCaseSequence.png`: The primary sequence diagram that encapsulates the main flow of interactions.
- `RequirementsTraceabilityMatrix.png`: An image mapping the project's requirements to their corresponding tests and implementation to ensure coverage.
- `UMLClass.png`: The UML class diagram depicting the structure and relationships of the system's classes.
- `lowBatterySequence.png`: A sequence diagram that describes the scenario when the system detects a low battery condition.

TermProject folder consisting of files to be compiled by Qt Creator.
